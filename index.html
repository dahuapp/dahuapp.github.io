<a name="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p>Dahu is an alternative to existing screencasting software. It allows combining a set of screenshots into an interactive presentation.</p>

<p>You may view a <a href="presentation/dahuproject.html">slide presentation of the Dahu project here</a>.

<h2>
<a name="project-goals" class="anchor" href="#project-goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dahu's principle</h2>

<p>Dahu is based on few ideas that distinguish it from other existing screencasting software:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Take screenshots as still images, not video.</strong>
  Videos are hard to edit and hard to navigate. Badly compressed
  videos are hardly readable. Instead, Dahu uses a succession of still
  images, that look like a video to the user. This approach is highly
  inspired from <a href="http://www.debugmode.com/wink/">Wink</a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Capture mouse position.</strong> While capturing, the
  mouse position for each step of the animation is captured. The
  generated animations show a smooth mouse movement from the starting
  point to the end point. Mouse positions can be edited after capture.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Annotate with tooltips, not voice.</strong> The
  explanations on the presentation appear as textual tooltips. This
  makes post-editing easy. The text is rendered as normal text in the
  presentation webpage, hence can be copy-pasted, searched, and
  indexed by search engines.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Standard web technologies.</strong> The generated
  animation use only standard web technologies (HTML, CSS,
  JavaScript). The can be viewed on any modern browser, without any
  plugin (not even flash). Among other advantages, this is what allows
  search engines to index presentation, and makes it easy to use any
  HTML elements like links within tooltips.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Multi-platform.</strong> The tool itself is written in
  Java and JavaScript. It requires a recent version of Java, but runs
  on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and probably other platforms as
  well.</li>
  <li><strong>Free and Open-Source.</strong> Dahu is available for
  free (both free of charge and open-source).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="project-status" class="anchor" href="#project-status"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dahu's Development Status</h2>

<p>Dahu is still in early stage of development. The presentation
generation works well, but not all features are implemented in the
graphical editor. To display tooltips in presentations, or use any
advanced features, you will need to use a text editor and edit the
<tt>presentation.dahu</tt> file (the <a
href="https://github.com/dahuapp/Dahu/wiki/User-manual">user-manual</a>
explains how to do this).</p>

<p>In other words, creating a presentation requires some
computer-science skills. The generated presentations are already
user-friendly however. They require a modern web browser (Chromium,
Firefox, IE version 9 or greater, ...).</p>

<h2>
<a name="download" class="anchor" href="#download"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Download</h2>

<p>The source code can be <a
href="https://github.com/dahuapp/Dahu">downloaded from GitHub</a>. You
will need Java >= 1.7 and Gradle to compile it.</p>

<h2>
<a name="alternatives" class="anchor" href="#alternatives"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Screencasting Software</h2>

<p>Even if there is a wide variety of software that offers to make
screencasts, none of these programs do offer effective solutions
combining the features / properties that we could expect of this kind
of tool. </p>

<p>Generally the approach is to make a video recording of an area of
your screen and to couple the audio. This approach sets several
problems for the capture (an error in your manipulation or speech
implies restarting everything or do some video collage), post-editing
(adding text, animations, and other, means video editing), export (the
formats are owner, and often too heavy), indexing (very difficult to
index a video or a Flash file), reading (not practical to have to move
the cursor to find the piece of information we are looking for: the
time or this or that thing is explained), aso..</p>

<p>A notable exception is <a
href="http://www.debugmode.com/wink/">Wink</a>, which was a great
source of inspiration for Dahu, but it is not open-source, runs very
badly on Linux, and does not seem to be maintained anymore. Also, Wink
generates Flash animations, which was a sensible choice a few years
ago, but is no longer a good idea: browser already offer the required
features without a plugin, and Flash is not available on all platforms
(e.g. iPad).</p>

<p>Other alternatives include <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/captivate.html">Adobe
Captivate</a> (commercial, not open-source) and <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/salasaga/">salasaga</a> (does
not seem maintained).</p>

<h2>
<a name="architecture" class="anchor" href="#architecture"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Architecture</h2>

<p>Dahu consists in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capture:</strong> a tool for capturing and editing, written in JavaFX and Java. It will allow : a) the recording of information linked to the screencasts and b) post-editing screencasts to add meta-data (eg, texts, animations and information about screencasts.</li>
<li><strong>Intermediate Format:</strong> an intermediate format to store the content, form and dynamics of screencasts. It is a simple JSon-based format, easily extensible and hand-editable if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> a viewer to view screencasts in a web browser (HTML5, JS, CSS).</li>
